		<h3>Personal Background:</h3> 
		<p>I was born in Texas, but I've lived most of my life in North Carolina. I love animals and have a few pets of my own! A dog, a cat, and a couple of fish.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Professional Background:</h3>
		<p>I went from working to be an event planner, to learning how to be a dog groomer, to finally settling on going back to school. My professional background is widely variably to say politely.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Academic Background:</h3>
		<p>I have been in and out of college since 2013. 
			I actually started out at CPCC for get my basics done before going to UNCG for their Community Therapeutic Recreations and Event Planning program. 
			They basically said the only thing that will get you into the field you were in school for was to volunteer and hope by year two that they'd hire you on for part time. 
			I decided after my first semester there that I was just wasting money. 
			Came back to Charlotte, tried to get into catering/event design for a bit, and then I sat down and really thought about what I want my future to look like.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Primary Computer Platform:</h3>
		<p>I operate on Windows. I do want to try out Linux more, but I'll get there when I get there.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Courses I'm Taking, and Why:</h3>
		
				<ul>
					<li>WEB210: Web Design - </li>
					
					<li>WEB115: Web Markup and Scripting - </li>
					
					<li>CSC154: Software Development - </li>
					
					<li>CSC151: JAVA Programming - </li>

		<h3>Something to Remember Me By:</h3> 
		<p>I have a mohawk that I started growing during quarantine. I've been back and forth on maintaining my mohawk, but I recently fixed it up when school started this year. 
		Oh, I can also recommend a specific dog breed for your lifestyle if you ask.
